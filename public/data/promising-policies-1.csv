The approach aims to promote gender equality in the distribution of care work and expand care infrastructure nationally with respect to regional diversity and needs. A main initiative under the Campaign focuses on “Territorial Parliaments for Care” which bring together stakeholders for the purpose of knowledge exchange, including on related topics such as local care strategies, collective vision-making, surveying local needs and proposing joint forms of action. To lead the work and monitor progress, the Interministerial Board of Care Policies was created bringing together 15 government agencies to drive forward and monitor the progress of the care agenda.
