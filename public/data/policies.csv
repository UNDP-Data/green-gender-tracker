CAN,Canada,Americas,Northern America,Labour market,Wage subsidy and income replacement for self-employed,Not specific,"Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS). 75% wage subsidy up to 847 CAD per week or 58,700 CAD per employee for eligible employers for up to 12 weeks, retroactive to 15 March to prevent job losses and allow for rehiring workers. The subsidy is available for a subset of employers, excluding public bodies, experiencing a drop of at least 15% of their revenues (for period 1), 30% of their revenues (periods 2-4). CEWS is administered by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) on a period-by-period basis, with each period spanning 4 weeks (with period 1 starting March 15, 2020). The wage subsidy program was put in place for an initial 12-week period from March 15 to June 6, 2020, providing a 75 per cent wage subsidy to eligible employers. On May 15, 2020, the government announced a 12-week extension, to August 29, 2020. On July 17, 2020, the government unveiled a redesign allowing more employers to access wage subsidy support while ensuring that support is better targeted to their needs, and proposed a further extension to December 19, 2020. Another extension has been done until June 2021 and implement other enhancements to the program to better respond to the evolving economic and health situation. These proposed changes will make the program more flexible and more generous, and ensure that the program provides continued support to employers.
- July 2020 changes: Changes to CEWS as of claim period 5 (Bill C-20): The subsidy rate varies, depending on how much your revenue dropped. If your revenue drop was less than 30% you can still qualify and keep getting the subsidy as employees return to work and your revenue recovers. For periods 5 and 6, if your revenue dropped at least 30%, your subsidy rate will be at least 75%, up to a maximum of $847/week per eligible employee. Employers who were hardest hit can qualify for a higher amount. Employees who were unpaid for 14 or more days can now be included in your calculation. Use the current period’s revenue drop or the previous period’s, whichever works in favour.
- Changes to CEWS as of November 19, 2020 (Bill C-9): The subsidy is extended to June 2021. The maximum subsidy rate for periods 8 to 10 will remain at 65% (40% base rate + 25% top-up) beginning in period 8, the top-up rate and base rate are is now calculated using the same one-month revenue drop. For periods 8 to 10, use the new top-up calculation or the previous 3-month average drop, whichever works in favour. The deadline to apply is January 31, 2021 Footnote1, or 180 days after the end of the claim period, whichever comes later. Starting in period 9, the calculation for employees on leave with pay now aligns better with EI benefits.
- Changes to CEWS as of January 6, 2021: details for claim periods 11 to 13 (December 20, 2020, to March 13, 2021): the maximum top-up subsidy rate is 35%; the maximum subsidy amount for employees on leave with pay is $595; and the base revenue drop comparison months for period 11 will be the same as period 10.
- On February 24, 2021, the government announced a technical change that would bring the CEWS legislation in line with the CRA’s current application of the deeming rule for claim period 11. The online calculator and spreadsheet already applied the deeming rule this way, so employers who used these calculators do not need to update their previous claims as a result of this update.

CAN,Canada,Americas,Northern America,Labour market,Labor regulatory adjustment,Not specific,"Work-Sharing (WS) is a program that helps employers and employees avoid layoffs when there is a temporary decrease in business activity beyond the control of the employer. The program provides Employment Insurance (EI) benefits to eligible employees who agree to reduce their normal working hours and share the available work while their employer recovers. Work-Sharing is an agreement between employers, employees and the Government of Canada.
Effective March 15, 2020 and extended to September 26, 2021, and not limited to one specific sector or industry, the Government of Canada is introducing temporary special measures:
Extension of the maximum possible duration of an agreement from 38 weeks to 76 weeks.
Mandatory cooling off period has been waived for employers who have already used the Work-Sharing program so that eligible employers may immediately enter into a new agreement
Reduce the previous requirements for a Recovery Plan to a single line of text in the application form
Reduce the requirement and expand eligibility to employers affected by accepting business who have been in business for only 1 year rather than 2, and eliminate the burden of having to provide sales/production figures at the same time, and
Expand eligibility for staff who are essential to recovery, Government Business Enterprises (GBEs) and non-for-profit organization employers.

CAN,Canada,Americas,Northern America,Labour market,Labor regulatory adjustment,Not specific,"Extension of lay-off periods (new as of November 9, 2020). In response to COVID-19, certain lay-off periods established under the Canada Labour Standards Regulations are temporarily extended. This temporary extension of lay-off periods gives greater protection to federally regulated workplaces. It provides employers more time to recall employees laid-off due to COVID-19. Prior to this temporary extension of lay-off periods, employees could be laid-off for up to 3 months, or up to 6 months if a recall date is provided in a written notice at the time of the lay-off. After these time periods, the lay-off becomes a termination. The allowable time before a lay-off is considered a termination of employment is temporarily extended as follows: 
-If an employee is laid off for a period of 3 months or less before March 31, 2020, the time is extended by 9 months after the day on which it would otherwise end; therefore, an employer would have up to 12 months to recall the employee before the lay-off is deemed to be a termination of employment for the period between March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2020. The time is extended and the employer has until March 31, 2021, to recall the employee before the lay-off is deemed to be a termination of employment.
- If an employee is laid off with an expected recall date or fixed period prior to March 31, 2020, the date specified in the written notice will be extended by 9 months or to March 31, 2021, whichever is earlier and the employer would have up to that period or date to recall the employee before the lay-off is deemed to be a termination of employment.
During the period between March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2020, the term of the lay-off is extended and the employer has until March 31, 2021, to recall the employee before the lay-off is deemed to be a termination of employment, unless a later recall date or fixed period was provided in a written notice.",https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/281531621024684216/social-protection-and-jobs-responses-to-covid-19-a-real-time-review-of-country-measures-may-14-2296,NO,NO,NO

The other 3 per cent are Medical Aid (MA) recipients who are unable to pay premiums, so their medical costs are covered by the Government through taxes. The out-of-pocket money is normally 20 per cent for NHIS beneficiaries and 0–15 per cent for MA recipients. However, due to the pandemic, the Government eliminated all cost-sharing associated with health services for COVID-19. Measures that support universal access to healthcare for all citizens, independent of labor market status or contributory records are classified as gender-sensitive.",https://www.unicef.org/reports/family-friendly-policies-workers-informal-economy,NO,YES,NO

These provisions will help women as many still cannot access essential health services and continue to suffer from preventable and treatable diseases. Also, as women make up to 62 percent of the country’s health workforce, cash transfers would help mitigate job burden due to surge of cases in health facilities in parallel to caring for infected family members, particularly the elderly, who are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 disease, and children who may be out of school due to closures. Moreover, under this component the provision of food and basic supplies to quarantined populations and COVID-19 affected households would be supported. The project will implement the cash transfer activities through National Commission for Social Action (NaCSA), in partnership with Anti-Corruption Commission. The project seeks an authorization for food expenditures from IDA financing to enable vulnerable people that are affected by COVID-19 to purchase food.

By March 31, 2020, the government formally launched a national voucher scheme to ensure that the 1.3 million eligible school-aged children will continue to have access to meals during COVID-19-induced school closures. Under the scheme, each school-aged child would receive 15 GBP per week voucher (equivalent to 3 GBP per day), with the vouchers being redeemable at all major supermarkets. The value of the vouchers exceeds the costs of free school meals, as the government recognizes the increased costs placed on parents given that they will not be purchasing food in bulk and thus will incur higher costs. Families with school-aged children can know their eligibility through the government website. The delivery of the vouchers will be under the responsibility of schools. The government has also provided the flexibility for schools to utilize their existing in-house caterers and hire a local meal delivery service provider, with the government reimbursing the additional costs.

The scheme is focused on employees able to operate at least a third of their normal time, those eligible would be paid by their employer for the hours that they work. For the hours not worked, the government and the employer would each pay a third of the wages, while the employee would forgo a third. However, due to the new restriction, the country is revamping the scheme. The employer’s contribution to the employee’s wages when not working will be only 5 percent. The state will pay 62 percent of the hours not worked, and the employee will still forgo about a third. In further changes, employees will be eligible for the job support scheme if they are working at least 20 percent of their normal hours. The measure was extended to March 2021.

In its guidance the TPR also allowed employers and scheme trustees to put pension funding payments on hold where absolutely necessary and to delay the submission of recovery plans where such information is currently expected. The Pension Regulator had given defined benefit transfers a three-month hiatus while also allowing employers to halt contributions in response to the Covid-19 crisis. The regulator published guidance on March 27 allowing DB schemes to delay member requests to transfer out of the scheme by up to three months. This is to give trustees more time to calculate cash equivalent transfer values (CETVs) as due to falling markets caused by the coronavirus pandemic, it is now more difficult for them to be sure of the underlying value of pension funds. Some schemes may have also experienced an increase in demand for CETV calculations which would place additional strain on administration teams.  Therefore, the three-month delay will allow schemes to focus on other administrative tasks such as pension payroll and retirement quotations. Freezing DB transfers should also prevent individuals being targeted by scammers or making poor financial planning decisions in response to the crisis.
