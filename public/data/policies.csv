Includes several sub measures that aim in general to contribute to the development of a circular and low-carbon economy. In particular, they seek to develop recycling, reuse, and industrial symbiosis. In addition to promoting
certain practices, the aim is to support innovation in waste and resource processing and to develop training in certain areas of the circular economy. Submeasures include: 1) ‘Brussels Regional Strategy for the Economic Transition’ of the Brussels-Capital Region
The aim of this reform is to design a regional strategy for economic transition by mobilising all regional economic policy instruments, achieving a better coordination and cooperation between public actors, as well as active participation of the private sector; 2) Circular Flanders is the central platform in Flanders aimed at facilitating the transition to a circular economy in cooperation with industrial partners, knowledge institutions, public administrations, banks and civil society; 3) The Flanders recycling hub measure aims to realise at least six important investments in new recycling facilities. The focus is on missing links in a number of value chains to enable local circular production, such as the recycling of nappies, mattresses, and textiles. Investments are also sought in the plastic and chemical sectors. 4) ‘Belgium Builds Back Circular’ of the Federal State -- This investment aims to accelerate the transition to a circular economy in Belgium. The objective is threefold: a) Avoiding market or policy fragmentation and promoting an integrated approach through
the creation of a circular coalition with a specific focus on federal competences for circular economy and the interfacing of federal competences with local and regional competences, such as the design for scarcity, reuse, repair and recycling, chemical safety, verification and certification of recycled content; b) Financing a total of 10 circular projects in industry and research centres to accelerate the transition and scale up in practice, targeting in particular projects on the substitution of hazardous chemicals and projects on eco-design; c) Raising awareness and informing SMEs through targeted campaigns, a website and the creation of a self-assessment tool for SMEs. 5) ‘Deployment of the circular economy’ in the Walloon Region -- research and development through the creation of innovation partnerships in two priority value chains, namely metals and construction materials. 6) ‘Circular economy & circular construction’ of the Flemish Region -- This investment aims to stimulate the scaling up and mainstreaming of the circular economy concept, focusing on promoting research at an industrial scale, innovation projects with industrial companies that allow for systemic impact and support the development and implementation of circular business models, pilot and demonstration projects and encouraging SMEs to explore how to make their business model and business processes circular.",EU assessed national recovery and resilience plan - https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021SC0172&qid=1624626286892,NO,NO,NO,NO,YES,YES,NO

The plan was drawn up by the Danish government in close collaboration with the Danish food and agriculture sector, which has committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2050. The Climate Action Plan for Agriculture contains concrete actions to reduce CO2 emissions from agriculture. One of the main components of the plan includes a 700 million kroner ($114 million) boost in public investments in research and innovation for biogas fuels and other technologies. In addition, the plan also includes a partial ban on farming on peat soil, through which carbon is being released. The measures put forward by the Danish government to reach a 7.1-million-ton reduction in CO2 emissions from agriculture can be divided into three categories: 5 million tons to be reduced via new technologies, such as pyrolysis that can convert livestock manure and straw into sustainable fuel; 1.6 million tons to be reduced via what are being referred to as yet existing instruments, such as afforestation and removing at least 88,500 hectares of the most climate-damaging lowland soils (that emit CO2) from production and converting them to nature; and 0.5 million tons to be reduced via agreements that have already been concluded. In addition, the Danish government aims to reduce nitrogen emissions from agriculture by 10,400 tons by 2027, increase support for organic agriculture, and make active use of EU funds to ensure a green transition within the agricultural sector.

Rehabilitation of the sites makes recreational use possible in rural areas. Furthermore, rehabilitation of industrial sites and contaminated lands will contribute to local economic activity and restore the environmental status around the sites. The aim of the initiative is to initiate the removal of the risk that the ten large-scale soil contaminations constitute and to rehabilitate the contaminated lands. Furthermore, rehabilitation of the areas provide a permanent improvement of the local environment while creating economic activity in rural areas. The initiative will be implemented by granting a subsidy to the Danish Regions (administrative entity on regional level) which holds the administrative responsibility for contaminated soil. The grant will be given on the condition that the Regions submit a project description in order to ensure cost effectiveness and focus on prioritised areas. In this process, the Danish state and Danish Regions will examine the possibilities of private co-funding in order to increase the speed of the effort. Furthermore, the government plans to evaluate the effort in 2023 in cooperation with parliament.  The Danish government plans to agree on a subsidy scheme with Danish Regions in May 2021. Immediately thereafter, the Regional Councils begin the process of prioritising needed actions for the specific sites according to site-status and characteristics, e.g. prepare tenders, agreeing on terms with contractors. In 2023, the government will evaluate the initiative with parliament and decide on whether further governmental intervention is necessary in order to ensure the remediation of the contaminated sites.

The German economy ministry wants to earmark at least 500 million euros to support the roll-out of charging stations for electric cars. The sum will be targeted at private users, including households and builders as well as to intensify the build-up of charging points in public buildings. In addition to the EV charging infrastructure investments, package includes an increase in the government buyer incentives for electric cars to 6000 euros per vehicle. And most importantly package includes an obligation for all gas stations to offer EV charging points.

These add a total value of just under €1 billion, to be supported both by grants from the Recovery and Resilience Facility and national funds.
Advancing the green transition encompasses seven investments to a total value of €518 million. These include: 1) De-risking a Low Cost Residential Retrofit Loan Scheme through the use of loan guarantees; 2) Accelerate Decarbonisation of the Enterprise Sector, through providing supports for Irish SMEs and exporters to address their emissions, and by investing in carbon measurement and abatement technologies for manufacturing companies; 3) A Public Sector Retrofit Pathfinder Project to undertake the deep retrofit of public office accommodation; 4) Enable Future Electrification Through Targeted Investment in Cork Commuter Rail, providing significant capacity increases on the Cork Area Commuter Rail network, including construction of a through platform at Kent Station, line doubling between Glounthaune and Midleton, and re-signalling, with a view to future electrification; 5) A National Grand Challenges Programme of mission-orientated funding to be rolled out by Science Foundation Ireland; 6) The Enhanced Rehabilitation of Peatland, encompassing the rehabilitation of 33,000 hectares of former industrial peatlands owned by Bord Na Móna; 7) River Basin Management Plan - Enhanced Ambition Programme, to upgrade a minimum of 10 waste water treatment plants not currently scheduled for upgrade whose discharges have been identified as being significant pressures on receiving water bodies.
Under Priority 3 on recovery and job creation 3 investments will be undertaken to a total value of €181 million. Of which, the Work Placement Experience Programme (WPEP) targeted at reaching 10,000 participants, and the Solas Recovery Skills Response Programme will see a range of additional educational and training programmes rolled out as part of the Skills to Compete and the establishment of the SOLAS Green Skills Action programme focusing on providing training to address climate and low carbon economy issues.

Promoting the impact finance is a major part of the first measure.  To wit, the ESG Finance High Level Panel established the Positive Impact Finance Task Force to hold discussions with investors, financial institutions, evaluators, and non-financial companies.  Based on those discussions, the Task Force drafted a Concept of Impact Finance, which it released in July 2020.  (source: https://investmentjapan.jp/esg/1261/). MOE has supported green bond and sustainability bonds nearly tripled to JPY1.0808 trillion (USD 102 billion) between 2017 - 2019. Based on this success, MOE doubled down on bringing impact investment to other asset classes. The Concept of Impact Finance was designed to help market participants understand the idea and spur them to implement it.  The Concept is not binding or enforceable.  It is intended as a reference that defines impact finance, provides a flowchart for implementation, and outline key points at each stage of the process.
