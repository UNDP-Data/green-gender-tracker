The resulting plan features five comprehensive pillars to respond to gender-based violence: 1) supporting victims, survivors, and their families; 2) prevention; 3) responsive justice system; 4) implementing Indigenous-led approaches; and 5) social infrastructure and enabling environment. Efforts to reach out to underrepresented communities are important parts of Pillars 1 and 4. For example, under Pillar 1, support is provided to enhance the capacity of organizations that provide support services for women, girls, gender non-binary, LGBT+, and two-spirit persons (2SLGBTQI+) experiencing violence. The plan emphasizes the importance of supporting organizations that have experience working in these communities to identify specific barriers faced and solutions needed. Under Pillar 4, the plan recognizes that Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQI+ people are more likely to experience violence, including homicide, than women who are not part of this community. Thus, the plan commits to working with Indigenous-led organizations and coordinating approaches across the Government to embrace a coordinated approach that will improve the capacity of organizations that provide support to these populations, with a specific focus on addressing root causes of violence in these communities.

The scheme provides a monthly cash transfer to citizens in the informal sector who had their incomes disrupted during COVID-19. All informal workers above age 18 who have a valid voter identification card can apply for and receive benefits through their mobile phones. For the duration of the emergency period, beneficiaries receive payments every two weeks into their mobile money account. Women receive a higher cash transfer of FCFA 12,250 per month while men receive FCFA 10,500 per month. The funds are intended to help informal workers meet basic needs such as purchasing food and water, phone time or paying utility bills. Since Togo had no social registry at the time, the February 2020 voter registry was used to identify beneficiaries because it included over 90 per cent of the country’s adults and indicated a person’s location and economic sector. To apply for the benefit, workers could use their cell phones; once their eligibility was verified, the transfer was automatically credited to their mobile money account. Digital tools and simplified eligibility checks enabled 30,000 informal workers to receive payments after two days of the programme’s launch. The programme also partnered with development agencies to expand funding and outreach throughout different regions in three separate waves. In total through 2021, the programme benefitted more than 815,000 people, 63 per cent of whom were women.

The subsidy was delivered for up to ten months and provided additional benefits for workers who were women, youth between the ages of 18 and 23, people with disabilities and people who receive disability pensions. The return subsidy line was available for employers in cases where they had to suspend employee contracts due to COVID-19 regulations and were trying to bring workers back. It provided a benefit of CLP 160,000 per month for male workers between ages 24 and 55, and a benefit of CLP 200,000 per month for workers that were women, youth, men over age 55, and persons with disabilities. To expand the size of the labour market and encourage employers to hire new workers, the hire line subsidy had a benefit of 50 percent of monthly gross salary for men ages 24-55 (with a maximum of CLP 250,000), and a benefit of 65 percent of monthly gross salary (with a maximum of CLP 290,000) for women, youth,  men over age 55, and persons with disabilities. Both lines of the subsidy were available for companies with less than 200 workers and applications were open between 29 September 2020 and 31 December 2021.

To lead the work and monitor progress, the Interministerial Board of Care Policies was created bringing together 15 government agencies to drive forward and monitor the progress of the care agenda. The Interministerial Board has remained active since its inception and in 2022, it developed a proposal for a national care law, Caring in Equality, that was submitted to Congress. The proposal works to promote the idea that care is a “necessity, work and a right,” and to develop robust care infrastructure, including an integrated care system, the modification of licensing programmes in the care sectors, and the adaptation of working hours in the public and private sector to support care needs.

Through the programme, roughly 12 million eligible families received PRK 12,000 which was intended to help cover basic food costs for a family for four months. The legacy of this programme, however, is increasing financial inclusion for women and strengthening overall safety nets, which were built into its design. Households that wanted to receive the benefit would apply and confirm eligibility using mobile phones and national identification numbers. Payments were then accessible through commercial banks, retail agents or ATMs with biometric verification systems. Emergency cash disbursements take place through Limited Mandate Accounts allowing the government to make cash transfers without requiring beneficiaries to own a phone. This is important because mobile phone ownership is not universal particularly among women in Pakistan. To enable rapid roll out, the Government expanded on existing social protection frameworks to reach economically disadvantaged groups who had previously received social benefits. Women recipients were directly targeted through prior registration in the Ehsaas Kafaalat “One Woman, One Account” programme, which provided 4.5 million women with financial support and helped them gain access to financial services and increase women’s control over household resources.
