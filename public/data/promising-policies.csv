Efforts to reach out to underrepresented communities are important parts of Pillars 1 and 4. For example, under Pillar 1, support is provided to enhance the capacity of organizations that provide support services for women, girls, 2SLGBTQI+ and gender non-binary persons experiencing violence. The plan emphasizes the importance of supporting organizations that have experience working in these communities to identify specific barriers faced and solutions needed. And under Pillar 4, the plan recognizes that Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA+ people are more likely to experience violence, including homicide, than women who are not part of this community. Thus, the plan commits to working with Indigenous-led organizations and coordinating approaches across the federal government to embrace a coordinated approach that will improve the capacity of organizations that provide support to these populations, with a specific focus on addressing root causes of violence in these communities. An additional 539.3 million CAD was committed to continuing these efforts as part of the 2022 Federal Budget.
