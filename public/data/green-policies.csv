Thus, by the second quarter of 2026, at least 682 of all buses in service in Austria are to be converted to zero-emission buses and the necessary infrastructure installed for their operation. Depending on which zero-emission propulsion technology is used for this (battery-electric, hydrogen fuel cell or overhead line), the number of buses can increase to 958. By converting currently fossil fuel-powered buses to zero-emission propulsion systems, i.e. electric buses, trolley buses or buses powered by hydrogen fuel cells, and at the same time using only renewable energy, emissions can be drastically reduced. The allocated budget for this measure is 258 million Euros. It also aims at significantly increasing the share of emission-free commercial vehicles and related infrastructures (1.B.4). Depending on the type technology used (battery-driven, hydrogen fuel cell) and how the availability of the models, the number of zero-emission cars can increase to 3,400 (from 458,253 current vehicles working with diesel) by the second quarter of 2026. This measure also aims at transforming heavy commercial vehicles, however this is subject to further funding. The budget for this measure is 50 million Euros.

In addition, the plan also includes a partial ban on farming on peat soil, through which carbon is being released. The measures put forward by the Danish government to reach a 7.1-million-ton reduction in CO2 emissions from agriculture can be divided into three categories: 5 million tons to be reduced via new technologies, such as pyrolysis that can convert livestock manure and straw into sustainable fuel; 1.6 million tons to be reduced via what are being referred to as yet existing instruments, such as afforestation and removing at least 88,500 hectares of the most climate-damaging lowland soils (that emit CO2) from production and converting them to nature; and 0.5 million tons to be reduced via agreements that have already been concluded.

Rehabilitation of the sites makes recreational use possible in rural areas. Furthermore, rehabilitation of industrial sites and contaminated lands will contribute to local economic activity and restore the environmental status around the sites. The aim of the initiative is to initiate the removal of the risk that the ten large-scale soil contaminations constitute and to rehabilitate the contaminated lands. Furthermore, rehabilitation of the areas provide a permanent improvement of the local environment while creating economic activity in rural areas. The initiative will be implemented by granting a subsidy to the Danish Regions (administrative entity on regional level) which holds the administrative responsibility for contaminated soil. The grant will be given on the condition that the Regions submit a project description in order to ensure cost effectiveness and focus on prioritised areas. In this process, the Danish state and Danish Regions will examine the possibilities of private co-funding in order to increase the speed of the effort. Furthermore, the government plans to evaluate the effort in 2023 in cooperation with parliament.  The Danish government plans to agree on a subsidy scheme with Danish Regions in May 2021.

In 2023, the government will evaluate the initiative with parliament and decide on whether further governmental intervention is necessary in order to ensure the remediation of the contaminated sites.

These add a total value of just under €1 billion, to be supported both by grants from the Recovery and Resilience Facility and national funds. Advancing the green transition encompasses seven investments to a total value of €518 million. These include several initiatives including: 1) De-risking a Low Cost Residential Retrofit Loan Scheme through the use of loan guarantees; 2) Accelerating Decarbonisation of the Enterprise Sector, through support to SMEs and exporters to address their emissions, and investments in carbon measurement and abatement technologies; 3) Public Sector Retrofit Pathfinder Project; 4) Enabling electrification through investment in commuter rail; 5) Enhanced Rehabilitation of Peatland; 7) River Basin Management investments. This overlaps with Ireland's Economic Recovery Plan, which has commitments to Gender Pay Gap Information legislation, Balance for Better Business which promotes gender balance in senior management and leadership positions in SMEs and start ups, and the Enterprise Ireland Action Plan for Women in Business which targets a rise in the share of women-led exporting companies. 8) Investments to accelerate decarbonisation of the enterprise sector - through providing supports for Irish SMEs (businesses with less than 250 employees) and exporters to address their emissions, and by investing in carbon measurement and abatement technologies for manufacturing companies

The environmental aspect of this programme refers to energy efficient construction + renovation. This measure will benefit people who are in financial need and those living in undignified conditions. The budget is 1.211 billion euros.
2) The Affordable Student Housing Program aims to provide fifteen thousand beds in student housing for higher education students by the 1st quarter of 2026, ensuring the displaced student's right to decent housing by reducing the respective costs, which is one of the biggest obstacles to the indispensable expansion of attendance in higher education and helping to minimize the direct costs of students and their families, with special emphasis on the socially and economically more vulnerable students.
